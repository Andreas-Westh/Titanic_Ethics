# Titanic_Ethics

I am going to attempt to do it in both R and Python, a csv file will be available :)

Prerequisites:
1. You have a Titanica account
2. You've made your own local .Renviron file (for an R-guide, see this [Guide](https://github.com/Andreas-Westh/Skjul_API-KEY_i_RStudio_Git))
    - Save your username as 'titanica_username = ...'
    - Save your password as 'titanica_password = ...'
    - If you have saved the .Renviron file in a different folder, change this path: ```readRenviron(".Renviron")```
